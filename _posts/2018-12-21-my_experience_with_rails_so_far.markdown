After starting with Sinatra, learning ruby on rails has been a much more rewarding experience. It has also been more mystical. The hardest thing to adapt to so far is learning about everything that I automatically have at my disposal by just generating a rails framework. With all the metaprogramming and background actions that go on it can be difficult to use some of the methods provided. As I become more comfortable with these, the experience has been much more rewarding. 

One aspect of Sinatra that I somewhat prefered over rails is that the routes and http verbs are defined directly in the controller. In Rails, the routes are defined in the config file and are sent to actions in the controller. When making a CRUD app that uses restful routes, it did become tedious to repeatedly write all of those routes in the Sinatra controller.  In Rails, you can declare all seven restful routes in one line with the resource method, but still have to write out all the actions in the controller. Sinatra's controller set up was a bit easier to start off but I can see the benefits of Rails.
