Up until a week or two ago, I had no idea what Amazon Web Service was or why it was so important. I had heard about it here and there, but did not think much of it. While networking, I was connected with an engineer who had an AWS certificate. He recommended a Udemy course by a Cloud Guru. I purchased that course and and plan to dedicate some time every day over the next month or two to complete it. Since there is no coding involved (at least yet) I don't think it would be wise to focus completely on the course. I want to stay as sharp as possible with my coding skills.

My understanding of AWS after one week is far from complete, but here is what I have learned. The reason that AWS is so valuable to smaller companies is that they can deploy a full functional site without needing to buy any physical infrastructure. You essentially can pay to use Amazon's powerful, secure computers and servers. Most of what I have learned about the actual infrastructure is about S3, or simple storage service. You can upload 'buckets', which are essentially folders, that contain files very easily. There are different types of storage also. There is the standard storage, and then there is infrequently accessed storage, which costs less. There are newer forms of storage also that use machine learning to place data in the correct type. These files are stored in 'availability zones', which are Amazon's data centers. Multiple availabilty zones in the same geographic area are known as 'regions'. I have a pretty basic knowledge so far, but hope to continue learning.
