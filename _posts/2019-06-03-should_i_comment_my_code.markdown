During my first coding course in college, code comments were usually about 10% of a project's grade. It would almost always be the last thing that I did. I would just go through and add maybe a sentence or two per function and call it a day. Looking back, it makes sense why my professor stressed commenting so much. The python code that I wrote probably had some very interesting design choices that would require some hand-holding to make readable. 

When I was starting out at Flatiron I thought that commenting code was mandatory and that it would be expected to have most lines explained. I don't think there was any time during my 5 months that commenting was even mentioned. For most of my project reviews I went through and added a couple comments here and there for me to go back to in case I froze up. Other than that, was very pleased that as long as I could explain my code I did not need to comment it. With a language like ruby, most lines of code are phonetic anyway. 

During some of my networking conversations, the topic of commenting has come up twice. Neither of those developers said that commenting was as important in professional development as it was made out to be in college. One explained that their tech lead specifically limited their comments. Code that has spanned multiple generations can have comments that are completely out of date and will ultimately make it difficult to read. I think a developer should strive to make their code itself readable and add comments sparingly.
