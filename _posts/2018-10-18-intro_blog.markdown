As a recently graduated physics and math student from Connecticut College, I hope to take the next step into computer science with Flatiron. I did not take any coding courses at school until my senior year. It felt like a natural application of the skills that I had already learned. Realizing quickly that I wanted to move into this field, I tried to take as many courses as I could before I graduated. Once I finished school, I felt like I had a solid foundation but needed to learn more before I could be marketable.
