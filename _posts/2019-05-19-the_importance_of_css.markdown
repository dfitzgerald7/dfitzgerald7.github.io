One consistent critique I have had with all of my projects is that they usually don't look as nice as I intend them to. I dedicated most of my time during these project weeks to the logic and structure of the app and then would add a framework like materialize or bootstrap to make it look decent without really doing much. Most of my experience with materialize is just copying and pasting the html from their website and not thinking much about it. While this is a very powerful framework that I will definitely use again in the future, I also want to have enough practice with it to feel comfortable making my own alterations. 

To start playing around with CSS, I did what I always do. Go to Youtube and code along with a video. I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE) and put in the time to watch it all first then try to code along without it afterwords. The finished code was a simple html app filled with ipsum lorem. There was a header, footer, and two side by side columns for the body. I could have reproduced this page with materiailze fairly easily, but I am glad that I took the time to do it in pure CSS. 

Overall, the concept of CSS is not overly difficult. HMTL tags are given attributes in a style sheet. Most of the battle is just learning what attributes are available and what is possible. This familiarity will only come with spending time on it. I think part of the reason that I shied away from it initially was because it isn't a programming language. Now I understand how important it is for your app to look good.
